# Vendor Setup

***Bleeker*** sends the seller a configuration sheet that allows you to define the main parameters of the solution :
* Graphical Identity
* Customer Journey
* Data Privacy
* Enabling Options


Unlike other Live Commerce solutions, the essential Seller configuration is done via the ***Bleeker*** administration and not via integration variables, in order to minimize integration with your technical environment. It also allows you to change the settings without doing any further integration steps.

:::danger -
It's ***Bleeker*** Live Shopping that integrates with your environment, and not the other way around !
:::

:::tip -
If you want to push the integration on your side, an *API REST* is at your disposal !
