# Welcome on the ***Bleeker*** documentation for technical integration
### Introduction

The Live Commerce ***Bleeker*** solution allows you to interact in live video with your customers from your e-commerce site. The solution integrates with the main e-commerce platforms (Magento, Salesforce, Proximis, Prestashop Shopify, etc.) very simply thanks to javascript widgets to integrate on your site.

Depending on the e-commerce platforms, the cart synchronization feature between ***Bleeker*** and your e-commerce may require the provision of access to your e-commerce API. Synchronizing carts for most Shopify, Magento, Prestashop and Salesforce e-commerce sites does not require API access.

The ***Bleeker*** video solution is based on the *WebRTC* protocol which allows real-time communications without plugin via a Javascript API. This system facilitates browser-to-browser applications for voice calls and video chat.
